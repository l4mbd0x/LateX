A virtualized network uses a single physical infrastructure to support multiple logical networks. Each logical network can provide its users with a custom set of protocols and functionalities. Much research work has focused on developing infrastructure components that can provide some level of logical isolation between virtual networks. However, these systems often assume a somewhat cooperative environment where all network infrastructure providers, virtual network operators, and users collaborate. As this technology matures and becomes more widely deployed, it is also important to consider the effects of and possible defenses against malicious operators and users. In this paper, we explore these security issues in network virtualization. In particular, we systematically discuss the relationship between all entities and potential attacks to illustrate the importance of considering security issues in the design and implementation of virtualized networks. We also present several ideas on how to proceed toward the goal of secure network virtualization in the future Internet.},

sourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Mi-

precisely the capacity they require when they require it.
In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud
providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital
costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared
physical infrastructure.  However, in this paper, we show
that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities.
Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that
it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, iden-
tify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then
instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the
target. We explore how such placement can then be used to
mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information
from a target VM on the same machine.},

	abstract = {The benefits of virtualization are typically considered to be server consolidation, (leading to the reduction of power and cooling costs) increased availability, isolation, ease of operating system deployment and simplified disaster recovery. High Performance Computing (HPC) environments pose one main challenge for virtualization: the need to maximize throughput with minimal loss of CPU and I/O efficiency. However, virtualization is usually evaluated in terms of enterprise workloads and assumes that servers are underutilized and can be consolidated. In this paper we evaluate the performance of several virtual machine technologies in the context of HPC. A fundamental requirement of current high performance workloads is that both CPU and I/O must be highly efficient for tasks such as MPI jobs. This work benchmarks two virtual machine monitors, Open VZ and KVM, specifically focusing on I/O throughput since CPU efficiency has been extensively studied [1]. Open VZ offers near native I/O performance. Amazon's EC2 “ClusterCompute Node” product is also considered for comparative purposes and performs quite well. The EC2 “Cluster ComputeNode” product utilizes the Xen hyper visor in hvm mode and 10Gbit/s Ethernet for high throughput communication. Therefore, we also briefly studied Xen on our hardware platform (in hvmmode) to determine if there are still areas of improvement in KVM that allow EC2 to outperform KVM (with InfiniBand host channel adapters operating at 20 Gbit/s) in MPI benchmarks. We conclude that KVM's I/O performance is sub optimal, potentially due to memory management problems in the hyper visor. Amazon's EC2 service is promising, although further investigation is necessary to understand the effects of network based storage on I/O throughput in compute nodes. Amazon's offering may be attractive for users searching for “InfiniBand-like” performance without the upfront investment required to build an InfiniBan- - d cluster or users wishing to dynamically expand their cluster during periods of high demand.},

	abstract = {Virtualization
separates applications, desktops, machines, networks, data and services from their 
physical constr
aints. Virtualization is an evolving concept, encompassing a broad range of 
technologies, tools, and methods, and can bring significant operational benefits to organizations 
that choose to leverage them. As with any evolving technology, however, the risks 
also continue 
to evolve and are often less understood than risks associated with more traditional technologies.
The intent of this Information Supplement is to provide guidance on the use of virtualization in 
accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard (PCI DSS). For the purposes 
of this paper, all references are made to the PCI DSS version 2.0.
There are four simple principles associated with the use of virtualization in cardholder data 
environments:
a.
If virtualization technologies are 
used in a cardholder data environment, PCI DSS 
requirements apply to those virtualization technologies.
b.
Virtualization technology introduces new risks 
that may not be relevant to other technologies, 
and
that must be assessed when adopting virtualization in
cardholder data environments.
c.
Implementations of virtual technologies can vary greatly
,
and 
entities will need to perform a 
thorough discovery
to identify and document the unique characteristics of their particular 
virtualized implementation, including a
ll interactions with payment transaction processes and 
payment card data.
d.
There is no one

size
-
fits
-
all method or solution to configure virtualized environments to meet 
PCI DSS requirements. Specific 
controls
and procedures will vary for each environment, 
according to how virtualization is used and implemented.},

	abstract = {The vulnerability of Cloud Computing Systems (CCSs) to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) is a significant concern to government and industry. We present a cloud architecture reference model that incorporates a wide range of security controls and best practices, and a cloud security assessment model – Cloud-Trust – that estimates high level security metrics to quantify the degree of confidentiality and integrity offered by a CCS or cloud service provider (CSP). Cloud-Trust is used to assess the security level of four multi-tenant IaaS cloud architectures equipped with alternative cloud security controls and to show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented. CCS penetration probability drops substantially if a cloud defense in depth security architecture is adopted that protects virtual machine (VM) images at rest, strengthens CSP and cloud tenant system administrator access controls, and which employs other network security controls to minimize cloud network surveillance and discovery of live VMs.},

	abstract = {Based on Blackhat report 
[11]
, we decided to investigate some possibilities to
attack VLANs (Virtual Local Area Network). We think that is important to study
this particular threat and gain insight into the involved mechanisms, as a breach
of VLAN’s security can have tremendous consequences. Indeed, VLANs are
used to separate subnets and implement security zones. The possibility to send
packets across different zones would render such separations useless, as a
compromised machine in a low security zone could initiate denial of service
attacks against computers in a high security zone. Another threat lies in the
possibility to “destroy” the virtual architecture, performing indeed a DoS (
Denial Of
Service
) against a whole network architecture. Recovery time would impact
significantly on the business operations; in addition of an additional compromise
threat during the time the subnets separations are removed, leading finally to
information disclosure.
As it seems possible to send packets across VLANs, our questions were:
?
What is the required effort to perform this?
?
What can be done in order to increase VLAN security?
In a first step we got familiar with the different in terms of strategy and supporting
tools. Then we set up a prototype demonstrating five attacks:
1.
Basic Hopping VLAN Attack,
2.
Double Encapsulated 802.1q VLAN Hopping Attack,
3.
VLAN Trunking Protocol Attack,
4.
Media Access Control Attack and
5.
Private VLANs Attack.
Based on [10], the hardenings of the switches succeed to protect VLANs against
the attacks, but this has rapidly increased the work of the administrator. Thus,
Administrators have to assess the ratio between the amount of work and the risk
to be attacked.},

The proposed dynamic honeypot architecture detects potential attacks in the initial phases and delays these attacks until a new honeypot virtual machine (VM) is extracted from the original VM which is under attack.

One of the most widely used tools is honeyd for creating honeypots. The logs generated by honeyd can grow very large in size when there is heavy attack traffic in the system, thus consuming a lot of disk space. The huge log size poses difficulty when they are processed and analyzed by security analysts as they consume a lot of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a system which addresses these issues. It has two important modules. The first one is logging module which saves disk space by reducing the log size without losing information. The second module is a log analyzer that can process this log to generate reports and graphs for the security administrators. The analyzer is backward compatible and can process the log file produced by honeyd as well. The experimental results show that the space required by log file reduces significantly.},

We applied the classification scheme to classify seven distinctly different honeypots: Google Hack Honeypot, Honeyclient, Honeyd, Honeynet, Honeytrap, KFSensor, and a network telescope. The classification successfully separated these honeypots into different classes. The overall classification pro- vided insight into current honeypot technology. Functional gaps exist around containment of malicious activity and utilization of non-network hardware in- terfaces. The classification also assisted us in predicting honeypot technology of tomorrow.

Honeypots are powerful tools, however the inadequate (or lack of) documentation and the high degree of configuration complexity are prohibitive factors in their deployment.

	abstract = {Clouds can be seen as a natural evolution of
the Internet, allowing the utilization of computing capabilities
maintained by third parties for optimizing resource usage and,
hence, potentially reducing costs. There are several elements that
compose the cloud infrastructure and its services, and all of them
must operate harmoniously. Among these elements, security is
essential to allow the creation and deployment of services resilient
to internal and external threats. This includes authentication
and authorization mechanisms to control the access to resources,
a fundamental need for any cloud-based solution where those
resources can be allocated on demand. If the authentication
mechanisms employed are not well orchestrated, the users
and/or their processes may be obliged to repeatedly authenticate
themselves toward the different elements that compose the cloud,
leading to unnecessary overhead and increasing the possibility
of information leakage. To address such security issues, several
cloud systems have started using some form of single sign-on
(SSO) mechanism to simplify the process of handling credentials
inside the cloud. Aiming to provide a structured overview of the
wide variety of mechanisms employed, we propose a classification
of SSO systems for cloud services, which can be used as a model
for comparing current and future designing instances of such
mechanisms. In addition, and aiming to validate the usefulness
of the proposed taxonomy, we provide a classification of existing
cloud-oriented SSO solutions.},

The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments.

Recently, nested virtualization has gained popularity in research as an approach that could enable cloud customers to use virtualization-based solutions within a cloud by nesting two virtual machine monitors, with the inner one under control of the client. In this paper, we compare the performance of existing nested-virtualization solutions and analyze the impact of the performance overhead on VMI-based intrusion detection and honeypot systems.},

cybersecurity analysts still desire much more alert accuracy and overall threat analysis
in order to secure their systems within cyberspace. Improvements to Intrusion
Detection could be achieved by embracing a more comprehensive approach in
monitoring security events from many different heterogeneous sources. Correlating
security events from heterogeneous sources can grant a more holistic view and greater
situational awareness of cyber threats. One problem with this approach is that
currently, even a single event source (e.g., network traffic) can experience Big Data
challenges when considered alone. Attempts to use more heterogeneous data sources
pose an even greater Big Data challenge. Big Data technologies for Intrusion Detection
can help solve these Big Heterogeneous Data challenges. In this paper, we review the
scope of works considering the problem of heterogeneous data and in particular Big
Heterogeneous Data. We discuss the specific issues of Data Fusion, Heterogeneous
Intrusion Detection Architectures, and Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) systems, as well as presenting areas where more research opportunities exist.
Overall, both cyber threat analysis and cyber intelligence could be enhanced by
correlating security events across many diverse heterogeneous sources.},

Network forensics is the process of investigation such attacks through analyzing network data and events. Many challenges are facing investigators due to the rapid growing of network scale and intruders’ skills. Honeypots are computer traps that are meant to be compromised to attract hackers and monitor their strategies and tools. Using honeypots provides a cost-effective solution to increase the security of an organization. Monitoring malicious traffic is useful for network forensics and intrusion detection systems. This paper focused on studying network forensics methodologies and tools in addition to developing a well understanding of honeypots terminologies and their value in network forensics. Honeypot tools differ in several aspects discussed here in an objective comparison. Moreover, Honeypots efficiency is evaluated versus network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS). Data received by traditional network tools can be correlated with honeypots captures to obtain more valuable evidence and clues. The study also provides a literature review of previous researches on honeypots aid to network forensics in addition to multiple recommendations to overcome honeypot limitations.},

ld is increasingly relying on cloud computing. 
It  is  the  technology  and  business  of  the  next  generation. 
The  increase  in  the  use  of  cloud  environment  is  followed 
by  a  rising  volume  of  security  problems.  Most  cloud 
providers support classical security syste
ms to avoid illegal 
access to the resources. But compromising a resource in a 
cloud  environment  is  easier  for  the  hackers  since  all  the 
resources  are  connected  together  and  monitored  using 
centralized 
controllers. If a single instance of a 
resource
is 
vuln
erable,  compromising  it  might  expose  other  instances 
or  resources  in 
the 
cloud. 
Also,  it is impossible to  have  a 
completely secure coding. Rather than giving much care to 
make  the  code  bug
-
free,  it  is  efficient  to  implement  fake 
services 
using
Honeypot
s
an
d  set  a  trap  for  the  hackers. 
The Honeypot gives us valuable information regarding the 
intruders.  In  a  cloud  environment,  running  a  Honeypot 
helps to  track  hackers  and  secure the  real instances  of  the 
resources. Also it can be provided as a Service which i
s 
an
additional  business  profit  in  clou
d. 
This  architecture  is 
based  on  a 
d
ecision 
and  a  redirection 
that  automatically 
filters attacks and save
s
the 
details about the attackers. The 
information about the attackers will help to block them and 
can  be 
used  t
o  take  legal  actions  against  them.  With 
Honeypots,  we  can  get  statistical  information  about  the 
attacker
s
and   the   types   of   attacks.   All   the   above 
information about the attackers can be given

purchase  this

to 
decide  on  further  actions  needed  to  be  taken.    Thus 
providing  Honeypot  as  a  Service

it 
also  secures  the  c
