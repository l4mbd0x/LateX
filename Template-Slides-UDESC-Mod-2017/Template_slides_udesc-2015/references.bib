Protecting network accessible Cloud resources and services from ever increasing cyber threats is of great concern. Most of the Network based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) being rule based and therefore only capable of identifying known attacks (through pattern matching). Traditional Anomaly Detection based IDS may generate more number of false positives. In this paper, we attempt to amalgamate IDS with Cloud computing. Introducing Honeypot in Cloud IDS design can greatly help in detecting potential attacks with reduced number of false positives. This research work provides an impetus to strengthen network security aspects related to Cloud computing to make it more trustworthy.},

A virtualized network uses a single physical infrastructure to support multiple logical networks. Each logical network can provide its users with a custom set of protocols and functionalities. Much research work has focused on developing infrastructure components that can provide some level of logical isolation between virtual networks. However, these systems often assume a somewhat cooperative environment where all network infrastructure providers, virtual network operators, and users collaborate. As this technology matures and becomes more widely deployed, it is also important to consider the effects of and possible defenses against malicious operators and users. In this paper, we explore these security issues in network virtualization. In particular, we systematically discuss the relationship between all entities and potential attacks to illustrate the importance of considering security issues in the design and implementation of virtualized networks. We also present several ideas on how to proceed toward the goal of secure network virtualization in the future Internet.},

However, the data controllers/owners worried about the privacy and accountability impact of storing their data in the cloud infrastructures as the existing cloud computing solutions provide very limited control on the underlying systems. The intuitive approach - encrypting data before uploading to the cloud - is not applicable to MapReduce computation as the data analytics tasks are ad-hoc defined in the MapReduce environment using general programming languages (e.g, Java) and homomorphic encryption methods that can scale to big data do not exist. In this paper, we address the challenges of determining and detecting unauthorized access to data stored in MapReduce based cloud environments. To this end, we introduce alarm raising honeypots distributed over the data that are not accessed by the authorized MapReduce jobs, but only by the attackers and/or unauthorized users. Our analysis shows that unauthorized data accesses can be detected with reasonable performance in MapReduce based cloud environments.},

	abstract = {Clouds can be seen as a natural evolution of
the Internet, allowing the utilization of computing capabilities
maintained by third parties for optimizing resource usage and,
hence, potentially reducing costs. There are several elements that
compose the cloud infrastructure and its services, and all of them
must operate harmoniously. Among these elements, security is
essential to allow the creation and deployment of services resilient
to internal and external threats. This includes authentication
and authorization mechanisms to control the access to resources,
a fundamental need for any cloud-based solution where those
resources can be allocated on demand. If the authentication
mechanisms employed are not well orchestrated, the users
and/or their processes may be obliged to repeatedly authenticate
themselves toward the different elements that compose the cloud,
leading to unnecessary overhead and increasing the possibility
of information leakage. To address such security issues, several
cloud systems have started using some form of single sign-on
(SSO) mechanism to simplify the process of handling credentials
inside the cloud. Aiming to provide a structured overview of the
wide variety of mechanisms employed, we propose a classification
of SSO systems for cloud services, which can be used as a model
for comparing current and future designing instances of such
mechanisms. In addition, and aiming to validate the usefulness
of the proposed taxonomy, we provide a classification of existing
cloud-oriented SSO solutions.},

challenges when considered alone. Attempts to use more heterogeneous data sources
pose an even greater Big Data challenge. Big Data technologies for Intrusion Detection
can help solve these Big Heterogeneous Data challenges. In this paper, we review the
scope of works considering the problem of heterogeneous data and in particular Big
Heterogeneous Data. We discuss the specific issues of Data Fusion, Heterogeneous
Intrusion Detection Architectures, and Security Information and Event Management
(SIEM) systems, as well as presenting areas where more research opportunities exist.
Overall, both cyber threat analysis and cyber intelligence could be enhanced by
correlating security events across many diverse heterogeneous sources.},

this project we conducted a study using honeypots within various cloud computing platforms ( such as
Amazon  EC2,  Windows  Azure  etc.)   with  the  objective  of  learning  more  about  what  kind  of  packets
they receive.  We used various honeypots such as Dionaea, Kippo, and Amun on our cloud instances and
gathered data about where attacks came from, what kinds of attacks were made, and differences among
cloud instances.  We discovered that most attack trafic comes from the US and China and that most
attacks are on SSH and HTTP. We also found that for the most part, attack trafic among the clouds
was quite similar.  We also identified Dionaea and Kippo as the honeypots which are most effective in
the cloud setting},

sourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Mi-
crosoft’s Azure and Amazon’s EC2, allow users to instanti-
ate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase
precisely the capacity they require when they require it.
In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud
providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital
costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared
physical infrastructure.  However, in this paper, we show
that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities.
Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that
it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, iden-
tify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then
instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the
target. We explore how such placement can then be used to
mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information
from a target VM on the same machine.},

It  is  the  technology  and  business  of  the  next  generation. 
The  increase  in  the  use  of  cloud  environment  is  followed 
by  a  rising  volume  of  security  problems.  Most  cloud 
providers support classical security syste
ms to avoid illegal 
access to the resources. But compromising a resource in a 
cloud  environment  is  easier  for  the  hackers  since  all  the 
resources  are  connected  together  and  monitored  using 
centralized 
controllers. If a single instance of a 
resource
is 
vuln
erable,  compromising  it  might  expose  other  instances 
or  resources  in 
the 
cloud. 
Also,  it is impossible to  have  a 
completely secure coding. Rather than giving much care to 
make  the  code  bug
-
free,  it  is  efficient  to  implement  fake 
services 
using
Honeypot

an
d  set  a  trap  for  the  hackers. 
The Honeypot gives us valuable information regarding the 
intruders.  In  a  cloud  environment,  running  a  Honeypot 
helps to  track  hackers  and  secure the  real instances  of  the 
resources. Also it can be provided as a Service which i

This  architecture  is

information about the attackers will help to block them and

Honeypots,  we  can  get  statistical  information  about  the

	abstract = {Given the sophisticated nature of cyber attacks, existing passive defensive techniques may soon deemed to be inadequate to protect network and data assets at a satisfactory level. On the other hand, active defenses are promising techniques that are based on a proactive strategy where one anticipates attacks and prepares for the neutralization of the threats. Honeypots are systems, either isolated production systems or emulated ones, that are configured to be deliberately vulnerable, with the ultimate goal to be probed and exploited by attackers. Honeypots are powerful tools, however the inadequate (or lack of) documentation and the high degree of configuration complexity are prohibitive factors in their deployment. In this paper, we present honeyCY, a system that integrates existing honeypots into a single system, offering visualization features via a web interface or an Android app.},

	abstract = {The benefits of virtualization are typically considered to be server consolidation, (leading to the reduction of power and cooling costs) increased availability, isolation, ease of operating system deployment and simplified disaster recovery. High Performance Computing (HPC) environments pose one main challenge for virtualization: the need to maximize throughput with minimal loss of CPU and I/O efficiency. However, virtualization is usually evaluated in terms of enterprise workloads and assumes that servers are underutilized and can be consolidated. In this paper we evaluate the performance of several virtual machine technologies in the context of HPC. A fundamental requirement of current high performance workloads is that both CPU and I/O must be highly efficient for tasks such as MPI jobs. This work benchmarks two virtual machine monitors, Open VZ and KVM, specifically focusing on I/O throughput since CPU efficiency has been extensively studied [1]. Open VZ offers near native I/O performance. Amazon's EC2 “ClusterCompute Node” product is also considered for comparative purposes and performs quite well. The EC2 “Cluster ComputeNode” product utilizes the Xen hyper visor in hvm mode and 10Gbit/s Ethernet for high throughput communication. Therefore, we also briefly studied Xen on our hardware platform (in hvmmode) to determine if there are still areas of improvement in KVM that allow EC2 to outperform KVM (with InfiniBand host channel adapters operating at 20 Gbit/s) in MPI benchmarks. We conclude that KVM's I/O performance is sub optimal, potentially due to memory management problems in the hyper visor. Amazon's EC2 service is promising, although further investigation is necessary to understand the effects of network based storage on I/O throughput in compute nodes. Amazon's offering may be attractive for users searching for “InfiniBand-like” performance without the upfront investment required to build an InfiniBan- - d cluster or users wishing to dynamically expand their cluster during periods of high demand.},

separates applications, desktops, machines, networks, data and services from their

technologies, tools, and methods, and can bring significant operational benefits to organizations 
that choose to leverage them. As with any evolving technology, however, the risks 
also continue 
to evolve and are often less understood than risks associated with more traditional technologies.
The intent of this Information Supplement is to provide guidance on the use of virtualization in 
accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard (PCI DSS). For the purposes 
of this paper, all references are made to the PCI DSS version 2.0.
There are four simple principles associated with the use of virtualization in cardholder data 
environments:
a.
If virtualization technologies are 
used in a cardholder data environment, PCI DSS 
requirements apply to those virtualization technologies.
b.
Virtualization technology introduces new risks 
that may not be relevant to other technologies, 
and
that must be assessed when adopting virtualization in
cardholder data environments.
c.
Implementations of virtual technologies can vary greatly
,
and 
entities will need to perform a 
thorough discovery
to identify and document the unique characteristics of their particular 
virtualized implementation, including a
ll interactions with payment transaction processes and

Cloud-Trust is used to assess the security level of four multi-tenant IaaS cloud architectures equipped with alternative cloud security controls and to show the probability of CCS penetration (high value data compromise) is high if a minimal set of security controls are implemented. CCS penetration probability drops substantially if a cloud defense in depth security architecture is adopted that protects virtual machine (VM) images at rest, strengthens CSP and cloud tenant system administrator access controls, and which employs other network security controls to minimize cloud network surveillance and discovery of live VMs.},

Using honeypots provides a cost-effective solution to increase the security of an organization. Monitoring malicious traffic is useful for network forensics and intrusion detection systems. This paper focused on studying network forensics methodologies and tools in addition to developing a well understanding of honeypots terminologies and their value in network forensics. Honeypot tools differ in several aspects discussed here in an objective comparison. Moreover, Honeypots efficiency is evaluated versus network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS). Data received by traditional network tools can be correlated with honeypots captures to obtain more valuable evidence and clues. The study also provides a literature review of previous researches on honeypots aid to network forensics in addition to multiple recommendations to overcome honeypot limitations.},

Honeypots can protect original systems while revealing new and unknown attacks at the same time. The proposed dynamic honeypot architecture detects potential attacks in the initial phases and delays these attacks until a new honeypot virtual machine (VM) is extracted from the original VM which is under attack. The extraction process is a modifying VM live cloning process which leaves sensible data behind and prevents internal data loss. This way, the newly created honeypot VM runs the same software in exactly the same up-to-date configuration. The honeypot controller redirects the delayed attack to the extracted honeypot VM and analyses its impact without risking the integrity of the original target VM. The proposed architecture benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of the cloud. It efficiently protects VMs of cloud users from contemporary network attacks while only few additional cloud resources are temporarily needed. The architecture deceives and misleads an attacker or an attacking source but does not influence the normal work-flow of the original VMs in the cloud. Based on a defined reporting format, cloud users can learn from attacks which have targeted their VMs and discover current misconfigurations and unknown vulnerabilities.},

	shorttitle = {Secrets \& {Lies}},
	abstract = {From the Book:I have written this book partly to correct a mistake. Seven years ago I wrote another book: Applied Cryptography. In it, I described a mathematical utopia: algorithms that would keep your deepest secrets safe for millennia, protocols that could perform the most fantastical electronic interactions-unregulated gambling, undetectable authentication, anonymous cash-safely and securely. In my vision cryptography was the great technological equalizer; anyone with a cheap (and getting cheaper every year) computer could have the same security as the largest government. In the second edition of the same book, written two years later, I went so far as to write: "It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics." It's just not true. Cryptography can't do any of that. It's not that cryptography has gotten weaker since 1994, or that the things I described in that book are no longer true; it's that cryptography doesn't exist in a vacuum. Cryptography is a branch of mathematics. And like all mathematics, it involves numbers, equations, and logic. Security, palpable security that you or I might find useful in our lives, involves people: things people know, relationships between people, people and how they relate to machines. Digital security involves computers: complex, unstable, buggy computers. Mathematics is perfect; reality is subjective. Mathematics is defined; computers are ornery. Mathematics is logical; people are erratic, capricious, and barely comprehensible. The error of Applied Cryptography is that I didn't talk at all about the context. I talked about cryptography as if it were The Answer. I was pretty naive. Theresult wasn't pretty. Readers believed that cryptography was a kind of magic security dust that they could sprinkle over their software and make it secure. That they could invoke magic spells like "128-bit key" and "public-key infrastructure." A colleague once told me that the world was full of bad security systems designed by people who read Applied Cryptography. Since writing the book, I have made a living as a cryptography consultant: designing and analyzing security systems. To my initial surprise, I found that the weak points had nothing to do with the mathematics. They were in the hardware, the software, the networks, and the people. Beautiful pieces of mathematics were made irrelevant through bad programming, a lousy operating system, or someone's bad password choice. I learned to look beyond the cryptography, at the entire system, to find weaknesses. I started repeating a couple of sentiments you'll find throughout this book: "Security is a chain; it's only as secure as the weakest link." "Security is a process, not a product." Any real-world system is a complicated series of interconnections. Security must permeate the system: its components and connections. And in this book I argue that modern systems have so many components and connections-some of them not even known by the systems' designers, implementers, or users-that insecurities always remain. No system is perfect; no technology is The Answer. This is obvious to anyone involved in real-world security. In the real world, security involves processes. It involves preventative technologies, but also detection and reaction processes, and an entire forensics system to hunt down and prosecute the guilty. Security is not a product; it itself is a process. And if we're ever going to make our digital systems secure, we're going to have to start building processes. A few years ago I heard a quotation, and I am going to modify it here: If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology. This book is about those security problems, the limitations of technology, and the solutions. Read this book in order, from beginning to end. No, really. Many technical books are meant to skim, bounce around in, and use as a reference. This book isn't. This book has a plot; it tells a story. And like any good story, it makes less sense telling it out of order. The chapters build on each other, and you won't buy the ending if you haven't come along on the journey. Actually, I want you to read the book through once, and then read it through a second time. This book argues that in order to understand the security of a system, you need to look at the entire system-and not at any particular technologies. Security itself is an interconnected system, and it helps to have cursory knowledge of everything before learning more about anything. But two readings is probably too much to ask; forget I mentioned it. This book has three parts. Part 1 is "The Landscape," and gives context to the rest of the book: who the attackers are, what they want, and what we need to deal with the threats. Part 2 is "Technologies," basically a bunch of chapters describing different security technologies and their limitations. Part 3 is "Strategies": Given the requirements of the landscape and the limitations of the technologies, what do we do now? I think digital security is about the coolest thing you can work on today, and this book reflects that feeling. It's serious, but fun, too. Enjoy the read.},

	abstract = {Based on Blackhat report 
[11]
, we decided to investigate some possibilities to
attack VLANs (Virtual Local Area Network). We think that is important to study
this particular threat and gain insight into the involved mechanisms, as a breach
of VLAN’s security can have tremendous consequences. Indeed, VLANs are
used to separate subnets and implement security zones. The possibility to send
packets across different zones would render such separations useless, as a
compromised machine in a low security zone could initiate denial of service
attacks against computers in a high security zone. Another threat lies in the
possibility to “destroy” the virtual architecture, performing indeed a DoS (
Denial Of
Service
) against a whole network architecture. Recovery time would impact
significantly on the business operations; in addition of an additional compromise
threat during the time the subnets separations are removed, leading finally to
information disclosure.
As it seems possible to send packets across VLANs, our questions were:
?
What is the required effort to perform this?
?
What can be done in order to increase VLAN security?
In a first step we got familiar with the different in terms of strategy and supporting
tools. Then we set up a prototype demonstrating five attacks:
1.
Basic Hopping VLAN Attack,
2.
Double Encapsulated 802.1q VLAN Hopping Attack,
3.
VLAN Trunking Protocol Attack,
4.
Media Access Control Attack and
5.
Private VLANs Attack.
Based on [10], the hardenings of the switches succeed to protect VLANs against
the attacks, but this has rapidly increased the work of the administrator. Thus,
Administrators have to assess the ratio between the amount of work and the risk
to be attacked.},

systems in general, as it is difficult to provide provably secure information systems and maintain them in such a secure state
for  their  entire  lifetime  and  for  every  utilization.  Sometimes,  legacy  or  operational  constraints  do  not  even  allow  a  fully
secure information system to be realized at all. Therefore, the task of intrusion-detection systems is to monitor the usage of
such systems and to detect the apparition of insecure states. They detect attempts and active misuse by legitimate users of the
information systems or external parties to abuse their privileges or exploit security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce
a taxonomy of intrusion-detection systems that highlights the various aspects of this area. This taxonomy defines families of
intrusion-detection  systems  according  to  their  properties.  It  is  illustrated  by  numerous  examples  from  past  and  current

	abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design, the implementation and the evaluation of a dynamic honeypot architecture which can be offered as an additional security service for cloud users in a cloud that offers Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Honeypots can protect original systems while revealing new and unknown attacks at the same time. The proposed dynamic honeypot architecture detects potential attacks in the initial phases and delays these attacks until a new honeypot virtual machine (VM) is extracted from the original VM which is under attack. The extraction process is a modifying VM live cloning process which leaves sensible data behind and prevents internal data loss. This way, the newly created honeypot VM runs the same software in exactly the same up-to-date configuration. The honeypot controller redirects the delayed attack to the extracted honeypot VM and analyses its impact without risking the integrity of the original target VM. The proposed architecture benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of the cloud. It efficiently protects VMs of cloud users from contemporary network attacks while only few additional cloud resources are temporarily needed. The architecture deceives and misleads an attacker or an attacking source but does not influence the normal work-flow of the original VMs in the cloud. Based on a defined reporting format, cloud users can learn from attacks which have targeted their VMs and discover current misconfigurations and unknown vulnerabilities.},

One of the most widely used tools is honeyd for creating honeypots. The logs generated by honeyd can grow very large in size when there is heavy attack traffic in the system, thus consuming a lot of disk space. The huge log size poses difficulty when they are processed and analyzed by security analysts as they consume a lot of time and resources. In this paper, we propose a system which addresses these issues. It has two important modules. The first one is logging module which saves disk space by reducing the log size without losing information. The second module is a log analyzer that can process this log to generate reports and graphs for the security administrators. The analyzer is backward compatible and can process the log file produced by honeyd as well. The experimental results show that the space required by log file reduces significantly.},

	title = {Virtual {LAN} {Security}: weaknesses and coutermeasures},
	abstract = {Based on Blackhat report 
[11]
,  we  decided  to  investigate  some  possibilities  to
attack  VLANs  (Virtual  Local  Area  Network).  We  think  that  is  important  to  study
this particular threat and gain insight into the involved mechanisms, as a breach
of  VLAN’s  security  can  have  tremendous  consequences.  Indeed,  VLANs  are
used to separate subnets and implement security zones. The possibility to send
packets  across  different  zones  would  render  such  separations  useless,  as  a
compromised  machine  in  a  low  security  zone  could  initiate  denial  of  service
attacks  against  computers  in  a  high  security  zone.  Another  threat  lies  in  the
possibility to “destroy” the virtual architecture, performing indeed a DoS (
Denial  Of
Service
)  against  a  whole  network  architecture.  Recovery  time  would  impact
significantly on the business operations; in addition of an additional compromise
threat  during  the  time  the  subnets  separations  are  removed,  leading  finally  to
information disclosure.
As it seems possible to send packets across VLANs, our questions were:
?
What is the required effort to perform this?
?
What can be done in order to increase VLAN security?
In a first step we got familiar with the different in terms of strategy and supporting
tools. Then we set up a prototype demonstrating five attacks:
1.
Basic Hopping VLAN Attack,
2.
Double Encapsulated 802.1q VLAN Hopping Attack,
3.
VLAN Trunking Protocol Attack,
4.
Media Access Control Attack and
5.
Private VLANs Attack.
Based on [10], the hardenings of the switches succeed to protect VLANs against
the  attacks,  but  this  has  rapidly  increased  the  work  of  the  administrator.  Thus,
Administrators have to assess the ratio between the amount of work and the risk
to be attacked.},

The process of redesigning and reconfiguring enterprise networks is ad-hoc and error-prone, and configuration errors could cause serious issues such as network outages. In this paper, we take a step towards systematic evolution of network designs in the context of virtual local area networks (VLANs). We focus on VLANs given their importance and prevalence, the frequent need to change VLAN designs, and the time-consuming and error-prone process of making changes. We present algorithms for common design tasks encountered in evolving VLANs such as deciding which VLAN a new host must be assigned to. Our algorithms trade off multiple criteria such as broadcast traffic costs, and costs associated with maintaining spanning trees for each VLAN in the network, while honoring correctness and feasibility constraints on the design. Our algorithms also enable automatic detection of network-wide dependencies which must be factored when reconfiguring VLANs. We evaluate our algorithms on longitudinal snapshots of configuration files of a large-scale operational campus network obtained over a two year period. Our results show that our algorithms can produce significantly better designs than current practice, while avoiding errors and minimizing human work. Our unique data-sets also enable us to characterize VLAN related change activity in real networks, an important contribution in its own right.},

	abstract = {VLANs offer a flexible, agile means of  securely organizing network segments within 
an enterprise. Despite the promise of  VLAN architecture to simplify network 
maintenance and improve performance, security questions have raised concerns and 
caused some network architects to re-examine the associated issues. One area of  
concern, VLAN hopping, involves a variety of  mechanisms by which packets sent 
from one VLAN can be intercepted or redirected to another VLAN, threatening 
network security. Under certain circumstances, attackers have been able to exploit 
these mechanisms, gaining the capability of  sniffing data at the switch level, extracting 
passwords and other sensitive information at will. As part of  the security assessment 
that is summarized in this paper, @stake performed a battery of  tests to evaluate the 
security features of  the Cisco Catalyst family of  products.  
@stake has earned international recognition for expertise in network and application 
security solutions, and has configured and deployed VLANs for many of  the world’s 
largest enterprises. Cisco Systems’ decision to hire @stake as an independent third-
party consulting firm relied strongly on @stake’s reputation in this field. 
The results of  @stake’s test sequences clearly demonstrate that VLANs on Cisco 
Catalyst switches, when configured according to best-practice guidelines, can be 
effectively deployed as security mechanisms. Best-practice guidelines appear in 
summary in this paper and are detailed extensively in the Cisco document,

And typically, there are several known applications (including yersinia, dsniff and macof) that provide potential attackers with the tools to penetrate VLANs and cause chaos.  Easy to find and download from the Internet, these toolsshow people how to exploit badly configured networks and physical weaknesses in the LAN, making it depressingly easy for them to launch a devastating VLAN attack. VLANs are implemented at layer 2 of the OSI network model.  The majority of layer 2 (data link layer) attacks exploit the inability of a switch to track an attacker, because the switch has no inherent mechanism to detect that an attack is occurring.  This weakness means that this same attacker can perform malicious acts against the network path, altering the path and exploiting the change without detection. While the number of possible attack vectors is large, here is a list of what I believe to be the top ten threats for organisations using VLANs in no particular order.},
